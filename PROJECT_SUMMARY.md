## 🚀 RUNNING THE APPLICATION

### Option 1: Automated (Recommended)
```bash
1. Double-click setup.bat (one-time setup)
2. Double-click run_app.bat (every time you run)
```

### Option 2: Manual
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
